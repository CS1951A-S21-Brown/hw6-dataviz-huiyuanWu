        <h3>Assignment 6 &laquo; Data Visualization Dashboard &raquo;</h3>
    </div>
    <!--  We included a basic HTML structure for the 3 graphs here. Feel free to change this if you'd like  -->
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-6">
            <form>
                <label for="input-years">type the years range from 1872 to 2015 here</label>
                <input type="text" id="input-years"/>
                <input type="button" value="submit" id="submit-year"/>
            </form>
            <div id="graph1"></div>
            <p>
                For graph1, I use scatter plot for the year and number of games played in that year.
                The default years is set to the latest 5 years. And the user can manually add year,
                but it's limited to one at a time. And the input range is [1872, 2020], anything outside
                that range or is already in the graph will throw an error.<br>
                I also tried to fit a regression line that will update when user adds a new year. The regression
                line will try to fit the number of games played in each year. The fitting ability is apparently 
                impacted by the outlier of 2020, which has only 7 games.
            </p>
            <div id="graph2">
                <h1>The top 10 teams (defined by the number of victories) in the history</h1>
                <h2>Hover to see the winning percentage</h2>
            </div>
            <p>
                I use map form to represent the top 10 teams (defined by the number of victories) in the
                dataset. You can access the winning percentage by hovering on each country.
            </p>
            <div id="graph3">
                <h1>The total match history for 2014 & 2018 world cup</h1>
                <h2>Hover to see the winning percentage</h2>
            </div>
            <p>
                Again I set the winning percentage as a criteria to evaluate different teams. But this
                time I also uses a flow chart to show the components of each team to include more information.
                We can see the top world cup winners (France and Germany) played a lot of games and have high
                winning percentages.

        <h2>List 3 reasons why D3 was helpful and improved your visualization (6 points)</h2>
        <p>
            1. D3 provides convenient ways reads data in and cooperate with Javascript's anonymous function.
        <br>
            2. D3 cooperates with html and css, so I can easily customize my visualization.
        <br>
            3. D3 provides a variety of external libraries to solve specific problems, like country maps.
        </p>
        <h2>
            List 3 reasons why D3 would not be the best tool for creating a visualization (6 points)
        </h2>
        <p>
            1. Comparing to matplotlib or matlab, D3 lacks the ability to deal with big data and provided
                scientific computing functions. <br>
            2. D3 requires background knowledge of javascript and web DOM, which might not be in the technique
                stack of a data scientist. <br>
            3. D3 is still evolving fast, and there's no tutorial from the official website about the latest 
                version.
        </p>
        <h2>Accessible Data Visualization (10 points)</h2>
        <p>
            Users with full sights will find those dashboards accessible, while users with visual disabilities
            might have difficulties to access the dashboards. To make the data chart accessible to blind people,
            I will add screen reader to the website, just as mentioned in “Why Accessibility Is at the Heart of Data Visualization”.
            And also, add more accessible design in my html to let user navigate through tab. A screen reader should help
            the visual disable users to better understand what the dashboard is about. Also, include alt text in the HTML
            will also help those users, since sometimes a dashboard is too complex to access by a screen reader. When that's
            the case, alt text can briefly describe what's that dashboard is about. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            I could add tabIndent to the html divs, and also include alt text for those svg. But I didn't implement that.
            One reason for not making my dashboard more accessible is I have to put a lot of extra works to send
            the same message by text. It is not easy to summarize the dashboards, especially the third one, which
            is basically every match in the latest 2 world cups.
